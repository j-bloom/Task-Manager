# Task Manager
This full stack application was written with the MERN Stack.  

This application was styled using tailwinds css, as I wanted to learn a new way to style my applications. 

To run this application locally, please run the following commands after cloning the repo:  
Navigate to the backend directory and run:  
- npm install express  
- npm run start  

After connecting to the DB and the server, navigate to the frontend folder and run:   
- npm install
- npm run dev
